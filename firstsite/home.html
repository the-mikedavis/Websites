            	<p>Welcome to my home page! This website was built entirely off of self-written HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While I am a student at the University of Miami (Class of 2019), most of my HTML and CSS knowledge is self-taught through resources like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target=_blank>Codecademy</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="info-headers">About me</h3>
                <a href="aboutme.html">I'm Michael Davis, a Computer Science student at the University of Miami. I am currently in my second semester with sophomore standing. While my formal training in Computer Science has been rather limited, I have skills in web design, web-game design, database structuring and sorting (in Java), and debugging...</a>
            </div>
                    
            <div class="languages">
            	<h4 class="info-headers">Familiar Languages</h4> 
                        
                <h5 class="language-headers">Java</h5>
              	<p>Java is the main language that I'm familiar with. Training that I've recieved with Java includes a week long introduction to Java at ID Tech Camps, a Semester 1 introduction to Java (CSC-120) course at the University of Miami which covered basic Java coding techniques, and a Semester 2 programming course (CSC-220) covering basic data structures, sorting, and manipulating data. In addition, I am a some-what active member of the StackOverflow community, where I help confused coders debug their code. Although I am most familiar with Java, I make relatively few pet projects with it. You can find some of these in my SandBox Github repository.</p>
                        
                <h6 class="language-headers">Javascript</h6>
                <p>Javascript is the language I have the most fun with. Almost all of my pet projects are written in javascript with the help of the p5.js library. This library allows its users to create interactive graphical content and can be used for making games on basic HTML driven pages. I learned all of my Javascript knowledge through my Semester 1 Creative Coding course (CIM-540). In this course, I learned how to utilize the p5.js library to create multiple games and graphics. To see some of these projects, check out my projects page.</p>
                        
                <h7 class="language-headers">HTML</h7>
                <p>My knowledge of HTML is functional but primitive. I can construct organized websites and create basic DOM elements. I learned almost all of my HTML from <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target=_blank>Codecademy</a> except for the DOM elements which I learned in my Semester 1 Creative Coding course.</p>
                        
                <h8 class="language-headers">CSS</h8>
                <p>Like my knowledge of HTML, I've learned all my CSS on my own time using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target=_blank>Codecademy</a>. As I build and flesh out more websites, however, my knowledge and familiarity with CSS grows.</p>
