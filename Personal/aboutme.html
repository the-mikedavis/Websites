                <p class="paragraphs">Hi, I'm Michael Davis. I'm a Massachusan in Miami studying Computer Science. I'm a first-year student finishing off my second semester, but I have sophomore standing by credits, and will have junior standing by the end of the semester. Because of this, I'm able to graduate by the Spring of 2019 and move on to get either my Masters or PhD. My primary interest in Computer Science is in the graphics side. As an aesthete and a former film major, I love to tell creative stories through highly visual mediums, and I plan to use my knowledge of coding as a tool to accomplish exactly that. In my free time, I'm a foilist fencer, an Olympic recurve archer, and a trained physique builder.</p>
