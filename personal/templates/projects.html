<h2><a class="large" href="/projects/attendance">
        Headless Stack Overflow Daily Attendance</a></h2>
<br>
<p>Stack Overflow awards a gold badge for checking into the site for 100 days in
a row. I wrote a simple script which uses the phantom.js headless browser to
log in and read the progress of the badge. Then I set this script up to run every
day.</p>

<h2><a class="large" href="/projects/rpfp">
        Randomly Generate a Field of Convex Polygons</a></h2>
<br>
<p>Sounds easy, but it's a bit harder than it looks, especially to make it look good.
This was a part of a class assignment turned wild.</p>

<h2><a class="large" href="/projects/raster">
        Client-side Minimalistic Inline SVG to PNG Rasterizer</a></h2>
<br>
<p>With dynamically rendered svg's, it can be hard to get a portable, widely viewable version.
There are no easy built-in tools for getting this done, and the existing tools are very heavy
(comparatively). I built a small rasterizer which converts my svgs and their inline styles to
png.</p>

<h2><a class="large" href="/projects/home-server">
        Making a Home Server from an Old Computer</a></h2>
<br>
<p>I had an old computer and GoDaddy Shared Hosting. You can infer what happened.

<h2><a class="large" href="/projects/webdb">
        Use MongoDB in Express Middleware to Store Node.js Website Traffic</a></h2>
<br>
<p>While I don't really need to store any information about the site, I wanted
some MongoDB experience. This middleware allows me to log your info to my
database!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a class="large" href="/games">p5 Games</a></h2>
<br>
<p>Games in p5.js. This is a purely javascript engine which runs applications
similar to what you might find with a flash player.</p>
