    <p>Refresh the page to get a new field of polygons.</p>
    <p>Why generate a field like this? This was for my AI class. An assignment
    was to navigate a field of random polygons with A* search. You could just
    hard code a random looking map, but I wanted to go further.</p>
    <p>This polygon field is
    generated using the feint circles, which are placed to not overlap. Below
    is the code which runs on this very page. Check it out!</p>
