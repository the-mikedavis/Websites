<p>Your money is important to you. Would you rather invest in an actively managed fund which picks stocks and bonds based on market research and intuition, or a passively managed fund (index fund) which picks stocks and bonds in a more conservative fashion based on an index of the market. To demonstrate the change, I've modeled the stock market as a game of Black Jack, in which two computer players, an actively managed fund and an index fund try to beat the house (dealer).</p>
<p>How does this work? Both firms use a heuristic which determines how much the player bets depending on the up-facing card of the dealer. The Active firm uses a heuristic that will bet the highest chip ($50) when the dealer is showing a face up card of 2 or 3. Then it will bet $25 if the dealer shows a 4, 5, or 6. It will do the same with the $10 chip for the cards 7, 8, and 9, and it will bet one of the smallest chips ($5) for when the dealer has a 10 or Ace showing. This is a very risky, high stakes betting style which can pay off big, but also runs the risk of losing huge loads of cash.</p>
<p>The Passive firm uses a heuristic which bets $10 when the dealer is showing a 2. (This is commonly considered to be one of the dealer's least advantageous hands.) Then it will bet a $5 chip for a dealer's card of 3 through 6. Then it won't bet anything when the dealer has an advantageous hand with a 7 or higher showing. This is a more conservative betting pattern which minimizes risk but also minimizes reward. </p>
<p>The difference can be seen if you run the simulation a few times. Sometimes, the active fund runs way up into the $4000's and sometimes it spikes way down to $0. The passive fund tends to follow the same trends but with much less intensely. The passive fund stays relatively stable.
