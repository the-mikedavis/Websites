# Personal Website: Current Version

This site is run with `node.js` and
`Express` with `nunjucks` templating and it's reverse-proxied by `NGINX`.
All of this is running on an old but reliable computer running `Elementary OS`.
Some CSS is by `Twitter Bootstrap` but most of it is custom. Graphics are
provided by `d3.js` and `p5.js`.
